```

A PowerShell quiz game written as part of UCWT PowerShell course.

Weights given to each answer are just pulled from a pool of 6 default weightings, not particularly set up in a "real" manner. Lots of room for improvements, of course, but it works. Code is commented decently throughout to explain functionality -- nothing mind-blowing.

Made in the course of two or so days in a few hours as a team project.
